The engines that allow executing federated queries are called **federated engines**. In SPARQL endpoint [federation engines evaluation](http://mex.aksw.org/mex-core#Experiment), the [query runtime](http://mex.aksw.org/mex-core#endsAt) is the central [performance measure](http://mex.aksw.org/mex-perf#PerformanceMeasure). In addition, the number of data sources selected, the source selection time, the number of intermediate results, the [precision](http://mex.aksw.org/mex-perf#precision) and [recall](http://mex.aksw.org/mex-perf#recall) are also important measures to pinpoint the limitations of the **federated engines**. \r\n\r\nWe have two type of configurations to run the experiments: 1) we specify the specification ([RAM](http://mex.aksw.org/mex-core#memory), [Hard disk](http://mex.aksw.org/mex-core#hdType), [Processor](http://mex.aksw.org/mex-core#cpu), etc..) of all the machines running the SPARQL endpoints, 2) the specification of the machine running the **federation engines**. In this use case, we exported the [LargeRDFBench] (https://github.com/AKSW/largerdfbench) results in to ``mex`` machine readable format. The selected **federated engines** can be directly compared using simple SPARQL queries over ``mex`` results, optimizing the results analysis process.\r\n\r\n### WASOTA\r\n***\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n\r\n* [MEX Vocabulary](https://github.com/AKSW/mexproject/tree/master/vocabulary)\r\n* [LOG4MEX Library](https://github.com/AKSW/mexproject/tree/master/log4mex)\r\n",
