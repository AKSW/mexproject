This project aims to facilitate the sharing and data management of machine learning experiment outputs. 

The first milestone was the [vocabulary definition](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology), i.e., the `schema definition` to describe and represent each machine learning **algorithm execution** and its **performance measures** in a concise (but comprehensive) way. At this stage, we want to achieve a **high level of interoperability**.

Futhermore, the development of *APIs* and the integration with *ML Tools* are goals in order to support different system architectures. 

Recently, we have started the framework's development, which aims to automatize the task of generating metadata for ``Java`` classes based on the concepts of ``reflection``, ``annotation`` and ``generics``.

For more information, please see the sub projects listed bellow:

### How to use MEX?

For **semantic web users** the usage is straightforward, once the vocabulary can easily be handled with semantic web technologies, such as [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/). After the generation, you can semantically validate the serialized file [here](http://mex.aksw.org/).

For **non-semantic web users**, there are two ways to use `MEX`: if you're coding, you can import an *API* (**log4mex**), which implements an interface to be consumed into the user code for directly exporting the metadata in a simple manner, regardless possible semantic web aspects. Alternatively, over existing *machine learning frameworks* (100% transparent process), such as [DL-Learner](http://dl-learner.org/), [WEKA](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) and [FAMa](https://github.com/duartejulio/fama). It's a ongoing work, feel free to collaborate ;-)

Most recently, we have introduced a novel approach to generate metadata out of ML runs: MEX Framework: A Java Framework for Generating Machine Learning Metadata

Finnaly, for **general and non-expert users** we've created an [user interface](http://mex.aksw.org/) for exporting the ML experiment metadata.
