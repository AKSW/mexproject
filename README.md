# The MEX Project 

* Create an Ontology to describe machine learning experiments;
* Provide related services and tools, such as importers and exporters;
* Create an algorithm to infer knowledge;
* Integrate with a RDF Data Validation process [RDF Unit];
* Integrate with a Bechmark System/Repository [Gerbil];

*Please see below some useful information*
